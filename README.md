## 1. The Problem
**Metro Manila vs. the Rest:** A huge portion of economic activities in the Philippines are still concentrated in Metro Manila and a few other urban centers like Cebu in Visayas and Davao in Mindanao. Many regions remain underdeveloped and struggle to attract investment.

On this dashboard we will see the economic indexes of the cities in Region 1. These are Laoag and Batac in Ilocos Norte, Vigan and Candon in Ilocos Sur, San Fernando and Agoo in La Union, and Dagupan, Alaminos, San Carlos, and Urdaneta in Pangasinan. 

The goal of this project is to visualize which cities in Region 1 are leading or lagging. This enables the government for benchmarking and best practice sharing, targeted support or funding and also healthy competition among LGUs.

## 2. Data Source

This project utilizes the open source data of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). It is an annual ranking of Philippine cities and municipalities developed by the National Competitiveness Council through the Regional Competitiveness Committees (RCCs) with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development.

I used Selenium and PyautoGUI to crawl and extract the data of the 10 cities.
